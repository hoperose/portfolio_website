                <p>As people ourselves who recently moved to Berkeley to start new life, we deeply feel that the connection to the community impacts the life quality and well-being. Being motivated by this sense, all five members indicated a preference for the "Connected Communities" category of the annual design competition <a href="https://bigideascontest.org/communities/" target="_blank">Big Ideas</a>, we got the <span id="challenge">challenge that is to describe a novel solution that leverages the capacity of technology to engage and enhance the wellbeing of communities, campuses, and cities.</span></p>

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>We collaboratively framed the problem statement and assumption by following the Lean UX principles. With very open ended prompt and the broad scope of target user, the promising idea <span>Hobby Connection</span> was selected with the following ideation process:</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div id="brainstorm" class="col-xl-4">

                    <img src="images/selected_idea.png" width="58" height="58">
                    <p> Based on the whole team’s expertise and constraints, the hobby connection idea was finally selected to work on.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="space"></div>
            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>With the hobby connection idea, we assumed that hobbies can be the key to motivate people (especially for those who are new to communities) to connect to others in communities.</p>
            <p>Three main questions - <span>how do people experience finding companions to pursue hobbies</span>, <span>what problems do they face in looking for hobby companions</span>, and <span>what tools have they used to find companions</span> were used to guide the idea validation through conducting user research.</p>
            <div id="interview" class="row">
                <div id="interview_one" class="col-xl-6">
                    <img src="images/meeting.png" width="58" height="58">
                    <h4>In-depth Interview</h4>
                    <p>To discover how people experience pursuing hobbies with companions, the team conducted 15 in-person interviews within one week at the Easy Bay area by following the guerrilla research approach.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-xl-6">
                    <ul>
                        <li>The new living environment and busy schedules are two major obstacles for finding companions to pursue hobbies.</li>
                        <li>The existing social media doesn’t work well in helping the user to find companions to pursue hobbies.</li>
                        <li>Most people are open to new hobbies as well as meeting new friends via pursuing hobbies.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div id="survey" class="row">
                <div id="survey_one" class="col-xl-6">
                    <img src="images/survey.png" width="58" height="58">
                    <h4>Survey</h4>
                    <p>To validate the qualitative research findings as well as help the user to build effective hobby connection product, the team created a survey to gather people’s opinions on hobby pursuing with companions. 145 valid responses were collected via Google Surveys within four days.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-xl-6">
                    <ul>
                        <li>54%(15% were neutral) of respondents struggle to find companions in their communities to pursue hobbies.</li>
                        <li>59.6% of respondents prefer to use social media websites to look for companions who have similar hobbies.</li>
                        <li>43.5%(40% were neutral) of respondents are feel comfortable to pursue hobbies with those they don’t know or have just met.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Three existing products - <i>WeGoDo</i>, <i>Meetin</i> and <i>Meetup</i> which  aims at connecting people with their hobbies and interests were identified from the interview. With these competitor products, we conducted the following competitor analysis based on three key factors - Hobby Choice, Activity Choice, and Schedule Flexibility which users value most, to have a better understanding of how the existing market satisfies the user's needs as well as inform our design solutions.</p>

            <div class="space"></div>
            <h3>Design Solution</h3>
            <p>Being informed by the insights uncovered in the user research, we decided to design the product as <span>a geolocated social platform with which people can get a plethora hobby choices and potential companions as well as freedom of selecting when, where and with whom they'd like to pursue hobbies in their communities</span>.</p>
            <div class="space"></div>
            <h3>Interaction Design</h3>
            <p>To better incorporate the user-centered design into the product design process, personas were created on the basis of two types of users learned from the user research.</p>
            <div id="personas" class="row">
                <div id="persona_one" class="col-xl-6">
                    <a class="image-link" href="images/persona_one.png"><img src="images/persona_one.png" alt="persona one" width="400" height="297"></a>
                </div>
                <div id="persona_two" class="col-xl-6">
                    <a class="image-link" href="images/persona_two.png"><img src="images/persona_two.png" alt="persona two" width="400" height="297"></a>
                </div>
                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Two Types of Personas</figcaption>
            </div>
            <div id="site_map">
                <p>With regard to the personas, the team brainstormed the features which our product should have. Then, the following sitemap was created to show the structure of the social platform application we were designing.</p>
                <img src="images/sitemap.png" alt="sitemap" width="715" height="454">
            </div>
            <div id="low_fi">
                <p>Being guided by the sitemap, we proceed with designing for an intuitive experience with more concrete interactive flows and UI elements. I created the following set of low fidelity mockups with Balsamiq by incorporating sketches shared by other team members.</p>
                <img src="images/low-fi.png" alt="low fidelity" width="715" height="474">
            </div>
            <div class="space"></div>
            <h4>Testing &amp; Iterating</h4>
            <p>The POP app was used to convert these low-fi mockups into a clickable prototype that can be played by the user via their mobile devices. <span>The first round of usability testing</span> was conducted with 15 target users (each team member worked with testing three users). After politely reaching out to the user and introducing the features of this product, we asked them to perform the task finding potential matches to pursue hobbies. During this process, we encouraged the participants to think out loud. Even though the testing task seemed very straightforward, users met different blockers and problems which were reflected on the following comments.</p>
