            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Taskit, a Bay Area-based startup, builds <a href="http://www.tas-kit.com/web/basic/login">a web-based task management application</a> that helps people optimally manage tasks of various shapes and sizes. However, <span>their users found it was difficult to quickly see at a glance the task progress as well as manage the workflow whilst on the go</span>. After deciding to build a cross-platform mobile app, the founder came to me and asked to help them address the problem and design the UX &amp; UI of this app.</p>
            <div id="role_time">
            <h3>THE SOLUTION</h3>
            <p>I adopted the Double Diamond approach to get a solid understanding of the problem to solve and then progressed through to the implementation, following the agile process to iterate with quick feedback from my client.</p>

            <div id="role_time">
            <h3>MY ROLE</h3>
            <p>As a freelance UX designer, I worked on designing and iterating wireframes, creating pixel-perfect mockups of the mobile app. With user research and competitor analysis, I helped the client capture user needs and turn those needs into solutions that can solve users’ pain points. I also collaborated with the engineering team in launching the app. This is a 5-week project.</p>

                    <p>In the kick-off meeting with the client, they walked me through three key features of their existing web-based application. Also, according to the market analysis and research done by their product manager, they talked about specific features that they already defined for the to-be-built mobile app.</p>

                    <p>Individuals as well as teams of all shapes and sizes, who have tasks to complete during a certain time period. Meanwhile, these tasks have steps and routes which can be recorded in a workflow format. Based on the target user identified by the client, I created the following two user scenarios which allow me to think about solutions by incorporating the environmental context when the user interfaces with the mobile app:</p>

                    <h4>A UX competitor analysis</h4>
                    <p>Given the context of Taskit mobile app, I conducted a competitor analysis that focuses on assessing three popular project/task management mobile apps (shown as below) to gain an overview of how they are designed for the user to track and manage the project progress.</p>

                    <h4>The Problem Statement</h4>
                    <p>On the basis of my client's needs as well as insights uncovered from the user research and the competitor analysis, I created a problem statement: As a part that will be seamlessly integrated with the existing web-based application in the context of mobile usage,<br><br>
                    <span id="problem_statement">how might we design the Taskit mobile app that helps the user easily keep track of their tasks and manage the workflow in just a few taps while keeping relevant others in the loop?</span></p>
                    
                    <div class="space"></div>
                    <h3>IDEATION</h3>
                    <p>Being guided by the problem statement and the research, I came up with the idea that consists of the following three information and data visualization techniques: </p>

                    <h3>WIREFLOWS</h3>
                    <p>In the first round wireframing, after the login/sign-up flow, a bottom navigation bar with three primary destinations was created to guide the user throughout the app:</p>
                   <!-- <img id="bottom_navi" src="images/bottom%20navi.png" alt="bottom navigation" width="414" height="59">-->
                    <ul id="navi_features">
                        <li> With the <span>Home</span> flow, the user can get a full list of tasks they are involved with; for each task, the user can first see at a glance the overview progress of the task with the donut pie chart; then, by tapping each workflow status, the user can track and quickly manage specific steps under those status with the tab panel (will add color coding scheme when it goes to high fidelity) based on the Kanban technique. Also, from the overview screen, the user can access the details of each task, track the activity history, and manage other relevant users.
                        </li>
                        <li>The <span>Notification</span> flow enables the user to check and process the collaboration invitations as well as view steps which approaches the deadline soon.
                        </li>
                        <li>The <span>Account Managing</span> flow allows the user to edit their personal account and log out the app.

                    <p>In addition to follow the iOS Human Interface Guideline as well as Material Design for Android, the minimalist approach was utilized to create the whole high-fidelity UI. Specifically, all screens have generous amount of white space which marks out the core functional elements of the app. A monochromatic color scheme based on the light sky blue theme color of the web-based product is used. Meanwhile, to maintain the consistency between the web-based product and the mobile app, the same set of colors that indicate task steps with the different status is used. Also, a set of simple and recognizable filled icons are used to represent the functionality as well as content. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Designed an efficient experience for the Taskit mobile app by incorporating effective visual tools such as Kanban technique, segmented donut chart and activity history tracking. </li>
                    <li>Simplified the navigation as well as optimized the user flow by reducing the number of screens and clicks.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Iterations brought my client feedback to ensure that the wireframing meets their needs. </li>
                    <li>Documentation of different iterations makes me give the client better visibility of the evolution of the design as well as the progress at each iteration. </li>
                    <li>Effectively collaborated with the engineering team in implementing the design.</li>
